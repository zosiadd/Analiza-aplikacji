My goal in this project is to find profiles of mobile apps that will be profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. I work as a data analyst for a company that develops mobile apps for Android and iOS, and my job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions about the type of apps they develop. At the company, we only develop apps that can be downloaded and installed for free, and our main source of revenue is in-app advertising. This means that revenue from any app is most influenced by the number of users using the app. The goal of this project is to analyze data to help developers understand what types of apps can attract the most users.
